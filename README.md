# ARM Microprocessor Programming on CPulator  

This repository contains ARM assembly programs developed and tested on the CPulator ARMv7 emulator, focusing on both fundamental operations and hardware-like control tasks.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Arithmetic and logic operations (add, sub, mul, div)  
- Conditional branching, loops, and subroutines  
- I/O control with LEDs and switches using memory-mapped registers  
- Handling input values from switches and producing output signals on LEDs  
- Stack operations and structured program design  

---

## ðŸ”§ Usage  
1. Open [CPulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm).  
2. Paste the assembly code into the editor.  
3. Assemble and run the program.  
4. Use the CPulatorâ€™s switch and LED panel to interact with I/O programs.

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose  
Beyond simple instruction practice, this project demonstrates how to interface with simulated hardware in CPulator. Writing assembly to control LED states and read switch inputs builds a deeper understanding of memory-mapped I/O, register manipulation, and real-world microcontroller behavior.
