# ARM Microprocessor Programming on CPulator  

This repository contains assembly programs written and tested on the CPulator ARMv7 emulator. It demonstrates fundamental ARM coding concepts such as arithmetic operations, control flow, memory manipulation, and stack usage.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Basic arithmetic (add, sub, mul, div)  
- Conditional branching and loops  
- Subroutines and stack operations  
- Load/Store instructions for memory handling  

---

## ðŸ”§ Usage  
1. Open [CPulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm).  
2. Paste the assembly code into the editor.  
3. Assemble and run the program to view output in registers/memory.

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose  
This project is a learning resource for students to understand ARM assembly, instruction sets, and low-level programming without requiring physical hardware.
